# GravelBox

GravelBox is a sandbox utility that allows the user to perform a controlled run of a binary executable, suspending it when the program attempts to perform actions such as writing/reading files, connecting to network, using the camera/microphone/speaker. GravelBox would then give the user an option to allow or deny this access. GravelBox would also have various configurations that can be set pre-run to allow/deny any combination of the permissions.
